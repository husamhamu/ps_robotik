Abstractâ€”The primary objective of this study is to present the
development of an AI-driven vehicle, JetBot AI, leveraging the
Nvidia Jetson Nano module. The focus is on implementing crucial
functionalities, including autonomous obstacle detection utilizing
camera inputs, navigation path planning, and vehicle motion
control. Through the analysis of environmental data, a safe
navigation path is generated to avoid obstacles effectively, and
the JetBot vehicle is accurately directed to execute the necessary
actions. The research incorporates advanced methodologies such
as map creation, obstacle identification, and obstacle avoidance
algorithms. The paper elaborates on the methods and procedures
employed to facilitate object detection, obstacle avoidance, and
path planning for the JetBot vehicle, employing mapping, tracing,
and sorting objects
